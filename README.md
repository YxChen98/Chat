A chatting software written in C#

Server is a console program
Open server then open client

Client is built using Unity3D
Open multiple client programms, and they will receive message from each other

The server IP Address is by default 127.0.0.1
So currently it can only run on the same computer
Will be modified more flexible for dynamic IP Address in later updates
