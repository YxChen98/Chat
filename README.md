A chatting software written in C#
==================================

Server
---------------------
Server is a console program.

Open server and it will wait connection from client.

The server demo is in /Server/bin/ChatServer.exe

Client
-------------
Client is built using Unity3D.

Open multiple client programms, then the server will display clients connected.

Now clients can receive message from each other.

The client demo is in /Client/demo, and extract the zip file.

Further improvement
-------------
The server IP Address is by default 127.0.0.1

So currently it can only run on the same computer

Will be modified more flexible for dynamic IP Address in later updates
